*Are you looking for study opportunities in China? Do you want to do research in one of the top universities in China? Are you interested in the use of GIS in transportation?*

[South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/en/) (SCUT) is one of China's leading universities directly under the Ministry of Education and one of the national 211 and 985 project universities. SCUT ranks among the top 200 in the World University Rankings 2021, and offers a wide range of MSc programs and PhD programs to support students to pursue their [MSc and PhD degrees](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sie_cn/hqzsjz/list.htm). Every year SCUT provides about 70 scholarships for full-time postgraduate students under the Chinese government scholarship program. The Chinese Government Scholarship (CGS) provides tuition fees and living allowance for outstanding international students to support their studies in a full-time MSc/PhD programme at SCUT.

We based at SCUT are currently looking for students to join our full-time MSc programme (3 years) and PhD programme (4 years) **Traffic Information Engineering and Control**. We encourage applications from candidates who have relevant expertise and knowledge in one of the subjects (such as geoinformatics, computer science, transportation, data science, geography or similar disciplines) and are interested in conducting cutting edge research related to the use of geographic information systems (GIS) in transportation. Students with interest in, but not limited to, the following topics are welcome to apply:

1). **Big spatial data analytic for environment modelling**    
This research focuses on the use of 2D and 3D big spatial data (such as land use data, residential building data, and green space data) to model physical environments (e.g., urban noise) and to derive environment factors that can efficiently and accurately represent environmental exposure.   
2). **Relationships between urban environments, mobility and health**    
The project aims to use novel regression models and advanced machine learning algorithms to study the relationships between built environments (e.g., streets, buildings, green and blue spaces), human mobility, and health.   
3). **Digital Twins for location-based services and navigation**     
The goal of this project is to develop 3D city models coupled with various sensor data to support location-based services for different types of agents (e.g., wheelchairs, pedestrians, and vehicles).

The successfully accepted candidates will be with the [School of International Education](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/sie_cn/main.htm) and will conduct their MSc and PhD studies within the Department of Transportation at the [School of Civil Engineering and Transportation](http://www2.scut.edu.cn/jtxy_en/), under the supervision of Associate Prof. Dr. Zhiyong Wang (https://zhiyongwang.netlify.app/).
