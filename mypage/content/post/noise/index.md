This project studied traffic noise Estimation from OpenStreetMap and used it for finding paths avoiding noise polluted areas.

* Developed traffic volume estimation models using machine learning techniques (e.g., random forest and decision tree) and deep learning algorithm (neural networks)
* Estimated traffic noise from OpenStreetMap
* Developed a navigation service to support quiet route planing for [OpenRouteService](https://openrouteservice.org/)

The developments of this project can be found at http://k1z.blog.uni-heidelberg.de/2017/07/10/reducing-stress-by-avoiding-noise-with-quiet-routing-in-openrouteservice/.
