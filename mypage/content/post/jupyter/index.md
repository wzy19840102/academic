The VDC project addresses vitality and public health related issues, and aims at 1). developing a data platform that can facilitate various vitality-related ‘living lab’ projects; 2). investigating the relationship between physical activities and built environments (such as green spaces and street networks). The developments from the project can be found in our Github repository, https://github.com/vitality-data-center.
