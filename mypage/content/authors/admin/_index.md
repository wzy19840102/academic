I was a researcher in the 3D geoinformation research group, at the Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands. I hold a PhD degree in Geomatics (graduated on 9 June 2015). My PhD research topic was "Navigation for first responders", which was supervised by prof.dr. S. Zlatanova (co-promotor) and Prof. dr. ir. P.J.M. van Oosterom  (promotor). In my PhD study, I focused on the approaches supporting path planning for first responder in the presence of moving obstacles.
