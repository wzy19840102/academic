I am a postdoc working in the Department of human geography and spatial planning at the Utrecht University. Before this, I was a postdoc in the GIScience research group at the Heidelberg University, Germany. I hold a PhD degree from the Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands (graduated on 9 June 2015). My PhD research topic was "Navigation for first responders", which was supervised by [prof.dr. S. Zlatanova](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-sisi-zlatanova) and [Prof. dr. ir. P.J.M. van Oosterom](https://www.tudelft.nl/bk/over-faculteit/hoogleraren/profdrir-pjm-van-oosterom/). 
I am focused on spatial data modeling, processing, management and analysis. My fields of expertise include geomatics, artificial intelligence (e.g., multi-agent system, machine learning), path planning, and optimization algorithms, etc. All of my publications can be found in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GkWO0hcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhiyong_Wang18). Currently I am working on the Vitality Data Center (VDC) project, which studies the relationship between built environments (e.g., streets, buildings, and green spaces) and physical activities (e.g., walking, biking, and running).
