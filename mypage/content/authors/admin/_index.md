I am an asssociate professor in the Department of transportation at the South China University of Technology. Before this, I was a postdoc with the Department of human geography and spatial planning at the Utrecht Universit and a postdoc in the GIScience research group at the Heidelberg University, Germany. I hold a PhD degree from the Delft University of Technology, in the Netherlands (graduated on 9 June 2015). My PhD research topic was "Navigation for first responders", which was supervised by [prof.dr. S. Zlatanova](https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-sisi-zlatanova) and [Prof. dr. ir. P.J.M. van Oosterom](https://www.tudelft.nl/bk/over-faculteit/hoogleraren/profdrir-pjm-van-oosterom/). My fields of expertise include geomatics (spatial data modeling, processing, management and analysis), artificial intelligence (e.g., multi-agent system, machine learning), path planning, and optimization algorithms, etc. All of my publications can be found in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GkWO0hcAAAAJ&hl=en) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Zhiyong_Wang18). I am also the secretary of ISPRS WG IV/8 [Digital Twins for Mobility and Navigation](https://www2.isprs.org/commissions/comm4/wg8/).

本人现就职于华南理工大学土木与交通学院[交通运输工程系](https://www2.scut.edu.cn/jtxy/2023/0110/c1889a490412/page.htm)。曾在荷兰乌特勒支大学（人文地理与空间规划系）和德国海德堡大学（地理科学研究组）从事博士后研究工作。研究兴趣包括地理信息系统，人工智能，路径规划和优化算法。
